The traces folder contains (deduplicated) loops from full traces of the sample
programs from the `target` directory.   (These aren't in git, since they're
large, see below). The reason to use the full traces is that we want them to be more
like regular code, as we'll be testing our reference loops against them
and look for false positives. 

After using referenceMaker, say for MD5, suppose we get a large number of ref
files (e.g., with md5b.c) First we can use dedup.pl to remove duplicates. 

Then we want to compare these MD5 loops to other code/algorithms to see if we
get false positives.  From the 'build' directory, run 
    ../test_vs_traces MD5 <path to new MD5 reference> ../testVectors/traces
This will compare the MD5 reference to multiple test programs, some containing
MD5, some not. The output will show which comparisons passed and failed.  For
failures, we can check the match files and see which reference loops are
causing a match, and optionally remove them.

Uncompress into testVectors, it will create the traces folder.
