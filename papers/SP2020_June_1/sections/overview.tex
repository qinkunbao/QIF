\section{Overview}
The shortcomings of existing work inspire us to design a new tool to detect
and quantify information leakage vulnerabilities in binaries. We capture the 
fined-grained semantics of each secret-dependent control-flow transfers 
and data-accesses. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Execution trace generation.} The design goal of \tana\ is to
    estimate the total information leakage as precisely as possible. 
    \item \textit{Instruction level symbolic execution.}
    \item \textit{Monte Carlo sampling.}
\end{enumerate}
