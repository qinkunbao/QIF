\section{Introduction}

Side channels are inevitable in modern computer systems. The attacker can infer sensitive 
information by observing the execution behavior. The software-based attacks(e.g., Cache-based 
side channels~\cite{184415,191010,7163050,Osvik:2006:CAC:2117739.2117741}, 
controlled channel attacks~\cite{7163052}) 
are especially common because these attacks typically don't need any physical access. 
After examing the root cause of those vulnerabilities, we believe that the implementation 
of software, which has different memory access patterns depending on the input secret 
during the execution, cause the following address-based side channels. Those side-channel
vulnerabilities can be exploited by observing the different memory access patterns. An
attacker can observe the pattern and infer sensitive information.

Various countermeasures~\cite{182946,203878,217537} have been proposed to defend against the 
address-based side-channel attacks. The basic idea is simple, identifying 
and eliminating secret-dependent memory access patterns. 
However, it can be very tedious and error-prone to find each leakage site manually. 
A lot of methods have been proposed to detect information leakages automatically. 
While those tools can typically report a list of potential leakages sites, they still 
face the following limitations.

First, existing tools~\cite{203878, 217537} can discover a list of potential leakage sites. 
But they fail to report how severe each potential leakage site could be. Most of the leakages 
found by those tools are typically hard to be exploited and leak very little information 
(e.g., one bit of the length of the key~\cite{203878}).  
It is worthwhile to have a tool to tell how much information is actually leaked. 
For example, some secret dependent memory access patterns in OpenSSL have been known 
for years. But the authors still don't fix them all because they think 
those vulnerabilities aren’t severe enough. The tool based on static analysis~\cite{182946} with 
abstract interpretation can give information leakage upper bound, which is useful to 
justify the implementation is secure enough. But they can’t indicate the leakage site 
is severe or not due to the over-approximation when those tools calculate information leakage. 
The dynamic method will take a concrete input and run the actual program. 
Those tools are typically very precise in term of real leakage. But none of those tools 
can actually report how many bits are actually leaked. For example, DATA~\cite{217537} reports more 
than 2000 potential leakage sites for the RSA implementation of OpenSSL. But most of 
them were dismissed by the author after some manual inspections.

Second, many open source libraries may have multiple leakage sites. 
A side-channel attacker~\cite{191010,7163052,hornby2011side} can exploit more than one leakage 
sites at one time. 
The attacker may retrieve part of the sensitive information from one site, part of the sensitive
information from another site and combine them.
It is hard know how much information is actually leaked in total. Adding those leakages 
simply gets a very rough upper bound estimate of the total information leakage if those 
leakages aren’t independent. No existing tools can practically estimate the total information 
leakage from multiple leakage sites in real-world open source libraries.

To overcome the above limitations, we propose a novel method
to more precisely quantify the information leakage. Previous work only considers the
``average'' information leakage which often neglects severe scenarios.
The average information assumes that the target program will have \textbf{different} sensitive 
information as the input when the attacker launches the attack,
which often does not match the attack scenario. During the real side-channel
attacks, an adversary may run the target problem again and over again with the 
fixed unknown sensitive information as the input. Therefore, the previous
threat model can't catch real attack scenarios.

In contrast, our method is more precise and fine-grained. 
For our analysis, the input key is fixed. We classify the address-based side-channel 
vulnerabilities into two categories: 1.\textit{secret-dependent control-flow transfers} 
and 2.\textit{secret-dependent data access} and model them with the math formulas which
constrain the value of sensitive information.
We define the amount of leaked information as the number of possible solutions that can
reduced after applying each constrains.
It is interesting to mention that the definition is different from the 
definition in previous static-based analysis tools. 
Before the attack, the adversary has a big but finite input space.
Every time the adversary observes one leakage site, he can eliminate some potential input and
reduce the size of the input space. The smaller the input space is, the more information is 
actually gained. On an extreme situation, if the size of the input space reduces to one, the
adversary can determine the input information uniquely, which means the total information is 
leaked. We define the leaked information as the proportion of the number of possible input 
that satisfies the attacker's observation.

Our method can identify and quantify address-based
sensitive information leakage sites in real-world applications automatically. 
Adversaries can exploit different control-flow transfers and data-access patterns when 
the program processes different sensitive data. We refer them as the potential information
leakage sites. Our tool can discover and estimate those potential information leakage sites 
as well as how many bits they can leak. We are also able to report precisely how many bits
can be leaked in total if an attacker observes more than one site.
We run symbolic execution on execution traces. We model each side-channel leakage as a math formula. 
The sensitive input is divided into several independent bytes and each byte is regarded as 
a unique symbol. Those formulas can precisely model every the side-channel vulnerability. 
In other words, if the application has a different sensitive input but still satisfies the formula, 
the code can still leak the same information.  
Those information leakage sites may spread in the whole program 
and their leakages may not be dependent. Simply adding them up can only get a coarse upper bound 
estimate. In order to accurately calculate the total information leakage, we must know the 
dependent relationships among those multiple leakages sites. Therefore, we introduce a 
monte carlo sampling method to estimate the total information leakage.

We implement the proposed method as a tool named \tool{} which can precisely discover and quantify the leaked information. 
We apply \tool{} on several crypto and non-crypto libraries including OpenSSL,
MbedTLS and libjpeg. The experiment result confirms that \tool{} can precisely identify the pre-known vulnerabilities,
reports how much information is leaked and which byte in the original sensitive buffer is leaked. 
The result shows that while those crypto libraries have a number of side-channels, most of them actually
leak very little information. Also, we also use the tool to analysis the two reported side-channel attack 
in the libjpeg library. Finally, we present new vulnerabilities. With the help of \tool{}, we confirm those
vulnerabilities are easily to be exploited. Our results are superisingly different compared to previous results
and much more useful in practice.

In summary, we make the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item We propose a novel method that can quantify fine-grained side-channel
        information leakages. We model each information leakage vulnerability as math formulas and 
        mutiple side-channel vulnerabilities can be seen as the disjunctions of those formulas, which
        precisely models the program semantics.
        \item We transfer the information quantification problem into a probabilty distribution problem and 
        use the Monte Carlo sampling method to estimate the information leakage. Some initial results indicate the 
        the sampling method suffers from the curse of dimensionality problem. We therefore design a guided
        sampling method and provide the corresponding error esitimate.
	\item We implement the proposed method into a practical tool and apply it on several real-world software. \tool{} 
        successfully identify the address-based side-channel vulnerabilities and provide the corresponding
        information leakge. The information lekage result provide the detailed information that help developers
        to fix the vulnerability.
