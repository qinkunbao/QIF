\section{Evaluation}
We evaluate \tana\ with the real-world crypto libraries and non-crypto. 
For crypto libraries, we choose OpenSSL and mbedTLS, two most commonly used
crypto libraries in today's software. For OpenSSL, we compile it with the option \textit{no-asm} 
to disable the assembly language routines. For non-crypto libraries, 
we study the libjepg, a commonly used lossy library implemented by 
the Independent JPEG Group. We build the source code into a 32 bit 
ELF binary with the GCC 8.0 on Ubuntu 14.04. Although our tool can
work on stripped binaries, we enable the symbol information to trace
back leakage sites into the source code.

We use Intel Pin version 3.7 to record the execution trace.
