We evaluate \tool{} with the real-world crypto libraries and non-crypto libraries. 
For crypto libraries, we choose OpenSSL, mbedTLS and NaCl. 
OpenSSL and mbedTLS are the two most commonly used
crypto libraries in today's software. NaCl (pronounced "salt") is a 
new software libreary for encryption, decryption and signatures, etc.
NaCl is designed to have no data flow from secrets to load address and no data 
flow from secrets to branch conditions. Therefore, NaCl should have no leakages
under our attack model. We build OpenSSL with the option \textit{no-asm} 
to disable the assembly language routines. 

For non-crypto libraries, we study libjepg, GTK and wget.
We build the source code into 32-bit x86 Linux executables with the 
GCC 8.0 on Ubuntu 14.04. Although our tool can
work on stripped binaries, we use symbol information to track
back leakage sites in the source code. We use Intel Pin version 3.7 
to record the execution trace. We run our experiemnts on a 2.90GHz
Intel Xeon(R) E5-2690 CPU with 128GB memory.
During the evaluation, we are interested in the following two
aspects:
\begin{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Leaked Sites Quantification.} Can \tool{} precisely
    report the number of leaked bits in open source libraries?
    \item \textbf{Existing Leakage Sites.} Recent work has reported a number
    of side-channel vulnerabilities in open source libraries. 
    Is the number of leaked bits reported by \tool{} useful to justify 
    the sensitive level of side-channel vulnerabilities?
   
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Evaluation Result Overview}
In this section, we present the overview of the evaluation result. \tool
find xx leakages in total from real-world cryptosystems and open
source libraries. Among the xx leak points, xx of them are leaked due
to secret-dependent control-flow transfers and xx of them are leaked  
due to secret-dependent memory accesses.
