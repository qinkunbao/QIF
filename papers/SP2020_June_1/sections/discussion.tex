\section{Discussions and Limitations}

\tool{} works on the native x86 instructions, while
some existing works~\cite{197207,BacelarAlmeida:2013:FVS:2483313.2483334} 
find side-channels vulnerabilities from source code level 
or intermediate languages (e.g., VEX, REIL). Apart from the scalability
issues for IR implementations, \tool{} is designed to work on the
native x86 instructions for the following considerations.

Those approaches will have the following limitations. 
First, many compilers can translate the operator into branches. For example, 
the GCC compiler will translate the ! operator into conditional branches. 
If the branch is secret-dependent, the attacker could learn some sensitive information.
But those source-based methods will fail to detect those vulnerabilities. 
Second, some if else in the source code can be converted into single conditional 
instructions (e.g., cmov). Source-based methods will still regard them as potential leakages, 
which will introduce false positives.
