\section{Threat Model}
We consider an attacker who shares the same hardware resource with the victim. 
The attacker attempt to retrieve sensitive information via memory-based side-channel attack. 
The attacker has no direct access to the memory or cache, but can probe the memory 
or cache at each program point. Similar to DATA, the attacker will face many 
noisy observations or can only observe a limited of memory or caches in practice. 
For the project, we assume the attacker can have noise-free observations. 
This threat model captures most of the cache-based and memory-based side channel attacks.
