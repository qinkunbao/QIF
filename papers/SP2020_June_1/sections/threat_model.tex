\section{Threat Model}
We consider an attacker who shares the same hardware resource with the victim. 
The attacker attempts to retrieve sensitive information via memory-based side-channel attacks. 
The attacker has no direct access to the memory or cache, but can probe the memory 
or cache at each program point. In reality, the attacker will face many possible obstacles,
including the noisy observations, limited observations on memory or cache.
But for this project, we assume the attacker can have noise-free observations. 
The threat model captures most of the cache-based and memory-based side channel attacks.
We only consider the deterministic program for the project.
