\section{Background and Related Work}
In this section, we first present a basic introduction about the several kinds of memory-based side-channel attack.
Those attacks are exactly what we attempt to study in the paper. Then we present existing work on side-channel 
detection and quantification.  
\subsection{Address-based Side-Channel Attack}
\subsubsection{Cache-based Attack}
\subsubsection{Memory-based Attack}

\subsection{Side-Channel Detection}

\subsection{Information Leakage Quantification}
