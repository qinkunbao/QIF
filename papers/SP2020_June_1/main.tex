\title{TANA: Fined-grained Side-channel Inforamtion Leakage Quantification in Binaries}
\author{Anonymous}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Side-channel attacks allow attackers to infer some sensitive information based on 
non-functional characteristics. Existing works on address-base side-channel detection 
can provide a list of potential side-channels leakage sites. We observe that those 
works still have the following limitations: 1) Many software may have multiple information 
leakage sites. Some vulnerabilities could be more severe than others. But existing work 
couldnâ€™t tell the difference between those leakages. 2)  An attacker usually exploits multiple 
leakages at one time. However, no existing tool can report how much information is leaked 
in total.

To overcome the above limitations: we proposed a tool called TANA, which can not only 
find the side-channel vulnerabilities but can estimate how many bits are actually leaked 
through the leakage. TANA works in three steps. First, the application is executed to record the 
trace. Second, TANA runs the instruction level symbolic execution on the top of the 
execution trace. TANA will find side-channel information leakages and model each leakage 
as one unique math constraints. Finally, TANA will classify those constraints into 
independent multiple groups and run the multiple step monte carlo to estimate the 
information leakage. TANA can report a very fined-grained vulnerability result 
compared to existing tools. 

We apply the tool on OpenSSL, MbedTLS and libjpeg and find several serious side channel 
vulnerabilities. We also evaluate the vulnerabilities from previous research. The result 
confirms our intuition: 
indicates most of the reported vulnerabilities are actually hard to exploit in practice.
