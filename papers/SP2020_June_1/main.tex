\title{\tool{}: Precise Fine-grained Side-channel Information Leakage Quantification in Binaries}
\author{Anonymous, v11}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    Side-channel attacks allow adversaries to infer sensitive
    information based on non-functional characteristics. 
    Existing work on address-based side-channel detections can identify 
    many tentative side-channel leakage sites. Those leakage sites, can
    leak one bit, two bits or many bits. However, no existing tools can
    precisely report the number of leaked bits for each leakage site.
       
    To overcome above limitations, we propose a novel method
    to precisely quantify the leaked information. We model each 
    leakage as a unique math constraint and use those
    constraints to divide the input space set into several subsets.
    Among those subsets, only one subset that satisfies every constraints.
    The cardinality of the subset correspondds to the amount of leaked
    information from those leakages. 


    We have developed a tool called \tool{}, which can not only 
    find the side-channel vulnerabilities but also estimate how many bits are actually leaked. 
    \tool{} works in three steps. First, the application is executed to record 
    trace. Second, \tool{} runs the instruction level symbolic execution on the 
    execution trace. \tool{} will find side-channel information leakages and model each leakage 
    as a unique math constraint. Finally, \tool{} will classify those constraints into 
    independent multiple groups and run a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to estimate the 
    information leakage. \tool{} can report a very fined-grained vulnerability result 
    compared to existing tools.
    
    We applied the tool to OpenSSL, MbedTLS and found several serious side-channel 
    vulnerabilities. Compared with previous research, the results are surprisingly different. 
    First, it shows most of the reported vulnerabilities are hard to exploit in practice. 
    Second, we also find some several sensitive vulnerabilities which are neglected before with \tool{}. 
    We confirmed those vulnerabilities with software developpers.
    %% which are confirmed with manual checks and software developpers.
