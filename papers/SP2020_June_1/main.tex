\title{\tool{}: Precise Fine-grained Side-channel Information Leakage Quantification in Binaries}
\author{Anonymous, v10}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    Side-channel attacks allow attackers to infer some sensitive 
    information based on non-functional characteristics. 
    Existing works on address-based side-channel detection 
    can provide a list of potential side-channel leakage sites. However, they 
    1) only consider the ``average'' information leakage 
    which often neglect severe attack scenarios,
    2) cannot accurately report
    the sum of multiple information leakages from various sites at one time.
       
    To overcome the above limitations, we propose a novel method
    to quantify the information leakage more precisely.  
    %% The key insight is ...  --- Qinkun: complete this and i will revise. ----
    %%---FIXME: NEED A BETTER NAME---%%
    The key insight is \fixme{XXXXX}.
    We have developed a tool called \tool{}, which can not only 
    find the side-channel vulnerabilities but also estimate how many bits are actually leaked. 
    \tool{} works in three steps. First, the application is executed to record the 
    trace. Second, \tool{} runs the instruction level symbolic execution on the top of the 
    execution trace. \tool{} will find side-channel information leakages and model each leakage 
    as one unique math constraint. Finally, \tool{} will classify those constraints into 
    independent multiple groups and run the Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate the 
    information leakage. \tool{} can report a very fined-grained vulnerability result 
    compared to the existing tools.
    
    We applied the tool on OpenSSL, MbedTLS and libjpeg and found several serious side-channel 
    vulnerabilities. Compared with previous research, the results are surprisingly different 
    that most of the reported vulnerabilities are hard to exploit in practice.
