\title{TANA: Fined-grained Side-channel Inforamtion Leakage Quantification in Binaries}
\author{Anonymous}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Side-channel attacks allow attackers to infer some sensitive information based on 
non-functional characteristics. Existing works on address-base side-channel detection 
can provide a list of potential side-channel leakage sites. We observe 
 the following limitations in the previous work: 1) 
Some vulnerabilities could be more severe than others, but the existing work 
cannot tell precisely the difference between those leakages. 2)  An attacker usually exploits multiple 
leakages at one time. However, no existing tool can precisely report
the sum of the information leakage from multiple sites given the information dependency among them.

---FIXME: EMPHASIZE NOVELTY AND METHOD---
To overcome the above limitations, we propose a novel method
to more precisely quantify the information leakage. Previous work only considers
``average'' information leakage given that the event, e.g., a branch condition, has not happened yet and
it could either happen or not happen in the future. For example, given a crypto key, we can assume the key is fixed
in the attack scenario because the attacker can fix the key and do profiling. The key insight is ...
By fixing with more constraints, we are able to obtain more precise information leakage.
Our results are superisingly different compared to previous results and muhc more useful in practice.

---FIXME: NEED A BETTER NAME---
We have developed a tool called TANA, which can not only 
find the side-channel vulnerabilities but can estimate how many bits are actually leaked 
through the leakage. TANA works in three steps. First, the application is executed to record the 
trace. Second, TANA runs the instruction level symbolic execution on the top of the 
execution trace. TANA will find side-channel information leakages and model each leakage 
as one unique math constraint. Finally, TANA will classify those constraints into 
independent multiple groups and run the multiple step Monte Carlo to estimate the 
information leakage. TANA can report a very fined-grained vulnerability result 
compared to the existing tools.
We apply the tool on OpenSSL, MbedTLS and libjpeg and find several serious side channel 
vulnerabilities. We also evaluate the vulnerabilities from previous research. The result 
confirms our intuition; it 
indicates most of the reported vulnerabilities are actually hard to exploit in practice.
