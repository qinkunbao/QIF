\title{TANA: Fined-grained Side-channel Inforamtion Leakage Quantifications in Binaries}
\author{Anonymous}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Side-channel attacks allow attackers to infer some sensitive information based on 
non-functional characteristics. Existing works on address-base side-channel detection 
can provide a list of potential side-channels leakage sites. We observed that those 
works still have the following limitations: 1) Many software may have multiple information 
leakage sites. Some vulnerabilities could be more severe than others. But existing work 
couldnâ€™t tell the difference between those leakages. 2)  An attacker could exploit multiple 
leakages at one time. However, no existing tool can report how much information is leaked 
in total.

To overcome the above limitations: we proposed a tool called TANA, which can not only 
find the side channels but can estimate how many bits are actually leaked through the 
leakage. TANA works in three phases. First, the application is executed to record the 
trace. Second, TANA runs the instruction level symbolic execution on the top of the 
execution trace. Tana will find side-channel information leakages and model each leakage 
as one unique math constraints. Finally, TANA will classify those constraints into 
independent multiple groups and run the multiple step monte carlo to estimate the 
information leakage. TANA will a very fined-grained result compared to existing tools. 

We apply the tool on OpenSSL, MbedTLS and libjpeg and find several serious side channel 
vulnerabilities. We also evaluate the vulnerabilities from previous research. The result 
indicates most of the reported vulnerabilities are actually hard to exploit in practice.
